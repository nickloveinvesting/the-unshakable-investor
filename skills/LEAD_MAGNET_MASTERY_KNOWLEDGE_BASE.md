---

### Core Principle (Hormozi)

> **"A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem that, once solved, reveals another problem your paid offer solves."**

---

### 2025 Conversion Benchmarks

- **Interactive content:** 20-40% conversion (quizzes, calculators)
- **Static content:** 2.9% average
- **Interactive beats static by:** 70%

**The Value Test:** Would someone pay $20-50 for this? If not, add more value.

---

## Core Psychology Principles

### 1. Reciprocity (Most Powerful)

**How It Works:**
When you give value first, people feel obligated to repay. This is hardwired into human psychology.

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- The stronger the free offer, the stronger the reciprocity trigger
- Reciprocity + surprise = 70% stronger conversion lift
- Must deliver SO MUCH VALUE that people feel "stupid saying no"

**Key Insight:**
```
Poor Lead Magnet: "Here's some tips" → Weak reciprocity
Great Lead Magnet: "Here's the exact system worth $500" → Strong reciprocity
```

**The Give-to-Ask Ratio:** 3.5:1 — For every 3.5 units of value you give, you earn 1 ask/sale.

---

### 2. Information Gap Theory (Curiosity Itch)

**How It Works:**
Our brains desperately want to close gaps between what we know and what we want to know. Unfinished tasks create mental tension (Zeigarnik Effect).

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Create a gap in your title that ONLY the lead magnet can close
- Reveal a problem they didn't know they had
- Tease a "surprising insight" or "counterintuitive truth"

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Marketing Tips" (no gap)
- ✅ "The 3 Marketing Mistakes Costing You $10K/Month" (gap: what are they?)
- ✅ "Why 90% of Entrepreneurs Fail at Delegation" (gap: why? am I one of them?)

---

### 3. Self-Determination Theory

**How It Works:**
People resist forced solutions. They want:
- **Autonomy** – Control over their choices
- **Mastery** – Progress toward competence
- **Relatedness** – Connection to others

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Empowering language: "You're the kind of person who..."
- Give options within the lead magnet
- Show a clear path to mastery
- Frame as "tools for YOU to decide"

**Language Shifts:**
- ❌ "You NEED to do this" → ✅ "You can CHOOSE to implement this"
- ❌ "Everyone must" → ✅ "Successful people tend to"

---

### 4. Social Proof & FOMO

**How It Works:**
We look to others' behavior to determine our own. Limited availability triggers urgency.

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Show download counts: "Join 5,000+ professionals who..."
- Testimonials on the opt-in page
- Limited spots: "Only accepting 100 participants"
- Time urgency: "Available this week only"

**FOMO Triggers:**
- Community signals: "Join your peers"
- Countdown timers (if legitimate)
- "Limited availability" (must be real)
- "Closing doors on [date]"

---

### 5. Loss Aversion

**How It Works:**
Losses hurt 2x more than equivalent gains feel good. People are more motivated to avoid loss than pursue gain.

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Frame around what they're LOSING by not taking action
- Show the cost of inaction
- "What's it costing you to stay stuck?"

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Get more leads" (gain frame)
- ✅ "Stop losing 30% of your leads to competitors" (loss frame)
- ✅ "The $10K/month leak in your business you don't know about"

---

### 6. Commitment & Consistency

**How It Works:**
Once someone takes a small action, they're more likely to take larger consistent actions. They want to be consistent with their self-image.

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Small commitments first: "Take this 2-minute assessment"
- Identity-based framing: "You're the type who..."
- Micro-commitments within the lead magnet
- Each small win leads to bigger wins

**The Ladder:**
```
Micro-commitment: "Take 2-min quiz"
         ↓
Small commitment: "Complete the assessment"
         ↓
Medium commitment: "Implement first tip"
         ↓
Large commitment: "Book a call"
```

---

### 7. Authority & Trust

**How It Works:**
We follow experts and trust credentials. But in 2025, traditional authority is less trusted—demonstrated expertise matters more.

**Application to Lead Magnets:**
- Show results and proof, not just credentials
- Case studies and specific numbers
- "As featured in..." (if real)
- Social proof from recognizable names

**2025 Trust Building:**
- Specificity signals authenticity (vague = skepticism)
- Show methodology, not just claims
- Vulnerability builds trust faster than perfection
- Real numbers beat vague claims

---

## The Hormozi Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

### Maximize the Numerator

**Dream Outcome (Increase):**
- Reframe around the FEELING, not the process
- "Sell Hawaii, not the plane ride"
- What will they FEEL when they achieve this?
- What status/identity do they gain?

**Perceived Likelihood (Increase):**
- Proof: testimonials, case studies, data
- Guarantees: risk reversal
- Authority: credentials, experience
- Specificity: detailed methodology

### Minimize the Denominator

**Time Delay (Decrease):**
- How fast can they get results?
- What quick wins can you provide?
- Can you speed up delivery?
- Show "results in 15 minutes"

**Effort & Sacrifice (Decrease):**
- What can you do FOR them?
- Remove steps/complexity
- Templates, scripts, tools
- "Done-for-you" elements

---

### Quick Win Requirement

The lead magnet MUST deliver a visible win in under 15 minutes. If it takes longer, they won't finish → won't trust you → won't buy.

**Over-Deliver Checklist:**
- [ ] Could I charge $20-50 for this?
- [ ] Does it include templates/scripts/tools (not just information)?
- [ ] Is there a "wow" moment where they think "I can't believe this is free"?
- [ ] Does it demonstrate my unique method/approach?

---

### The Problem-Solution-Cycle Bridge

**The Logic:**
1. Lead magnet solves Problem A perfectly
2. They experience the win
3. The win reveals Problem B (which they couldn't see before)
4. Your paid offer solves Problem B

**Why This Works:**
- Proves your expertise (you solved Problem A)
- Creates desire (they now see Problem B clearly)
- Builds trust (you over-delivered on the free thing)
- Natural progression (not a hard sell)

**Example:**
```
Free: Assessment scores burnout + identifies root cause
      → Solves "Am I burned out?" (Problem A)

Reveals: "You're burned out because you lack systems"
         → Creates awareness of Problem B

Paid: 90-day transformation program
      → Solves "How do I build systems?" (Problem B)
```

---

### The Wenger-Trayner Value Creation Stages

**5 Levels of Value a Lead Magnet Can Deliver:**

| Level | Type | Description | Example |
|-------|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Immediate** | Quick win they see right away | "Your score is 67/100" |
| 2 | **Potential** | Knowledge they can use now or later | "Here's what that score means" |
| 3 | **Applied** | Changes in practice | "Implement this fix today" |
| 4 | **Realized** | Tangible results achieved | "Saved 5 hours this week" |
| 5 | **Transformative** | Identity/belief shift | "I'm now a systems thinker" |

**Goal:** Best lead magnets deliver at least levels 1 + 2. Great ones touch all 5.

---

### The 5 Awareness Levels (Eugene Schwartz)

**Level 1: Unaware**
- Don't know they have a problem
- Lead magnet approach: Problem revelation ("Take this quiz to see if...")

**Level 2: Problem-Aware**
- Know the problem, not acting
- Lead magnet approach: Agitate + show solution exists

**Level 3: Solution-Aware**
- Know solutions exist, gathering info
- Lead magnet approach: Educate + differentiate your approach

**Level 4: Product-Aware**
- Know your solution, evaluating
- Lead magnet approach: Proof + case studies + comparison

**Level 5: Most Aware**
- Ready to buy, need final push
- Lead magnet approach: Discount, trial, or direct offer

**Best Lead Magnet Sweet Spot:** Levels 2-3 (they know the problem, looking for solutions)

---

### The Coaching Lead Magnet Psychology

**What High-Converting Coaching Lead Magnets Do:**

1. **Filter, don't just attract** – Naturally disqualify wrong-fit people
2. **Give a taste of the method** – Not just info, show HOW you solve it
3. **Create desire** – Leave them wanting more, not overwhelmed
4. **Build trust through taste** – Sample of teaching style + quality

**The Key Insight:**
```
Lead Magnet ≠ Just email list builder

Lead Magnet = 
   Email list builder
   + Emotional desire for paid offer
   + Nurture sequence trigger
   + Trust proof

By the time they finish, they should feel:
"I NEED this person's paid program"
```

---

### Psychology Quick Checklist

Before launching, verify:

- [ ] **Reciprocity:** Is the value SO high they feel obligated?
- [ ] **Curiosity:** Is there a gap that only this can close?
- [ ] **Self-determination:** Do they feel in control?
- [ ] **Social proof:** Do they see others succeeding?
- [ ] **Loss aversion:** Do they feel the cost of inaction?
- [ ] **Commitment:** Is there a small first step?
- [ ] **Authority:** Do you demonstrate (not claim) expertise?

---

## The 5-Phase Lead Magnet Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Audience Deep-Dive

**Before creating ANYTHING, answer these:**

1. **Who exactly is this for?** (Be specific: job title, situation, pain level)
2. **What's their awareness level?**
   - Level 1: Unaware of the problem
   - Level 2: Problem-aware, not acting
   - Level 3: Gathering information
   - Level 4: Evaluating solutions
   - Level 5: Ready to buy
3. **What's the ONE narrow problem they desperately want solved?**
4. **What language do THEY use to describe it?** (Not your words—theirs)

**Pain Point Mapping (StoryBrand 3-Level):**
```
External Problem: What's the surface-level issue?
   → "I can't get enough leads"

Internal Problem: How does it make them FEEL?
   → "I feel like a failure, embarrassed to check my pipeline"

Philosophical Problem: Why is this WRONG?
   → "Talented people shouldn't have to struggle to find clients"
```

**JTBD Questions:**
- What JOB are they hiring this lead magnet to do?
- What TRIGGERS them to search for a solution?
- What OUTCOMES do they expect?
- What OBSTACLES prevent them from achieving it alone?

---

### Phase 2: Concept Development

**Step 1: Select the Narrow Problem**

The lead magnet must solve ONE specific problem COMPLETELY. Not a broad topic—a narrow slice.

**The Hormozi Problem Types:**
| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Diagnosis** | Reveal a problem they didn't know they had | "Your Website Speed Score" |
| **Sample/Trial** | Limited-time access to your solution | "7-Day Free Trial" |
| **One Step** | Complete first step of multi-step process | "Module 1 of the Course" |

**Narrow Problem Test:**
- ❌ "Marketing Guide" (too broad)
- ❌ "How to Get Leads" (still broad)
- ✅ "The 3-Email Sequence That Books Discovery Calls" (specific, actionable)

**Step 2: Design the Problem-Solution-Cycle Bridge**
```
Lead Magnet solves → Problem A (narrow, complete)
                     ↓
         Solving A reveals → Problem B (bigger)
                             ↓
              Your Paid Offer solves → Problem B
```

**Example:**
- Lead Magnet: "Burnout Score Assessment" → solves "Am I burned out?" (Problem A)
- Reveals: "You're burned out because you lack systems" (Problem B)
- Paid Offer: "90-Day Transformation Program" → solves system building (Problem B)

---

### Phase 3: Value Architecture

**Maximize Value By:**
1. **Increase Dream Outcome:** Make the promise bigger (but believable)
2. **Increase Likelihood:** Add proof, testimonials, methodology
3. **Decrease Time Delay:** Deliver results FAST (15 min or less)
4. **Decrease Effort:** Make it easy to consume and implement

---

### Phase 4: Title & Hook Creation

**The #1 Rule:** Specificity beats generality. Always.

See the [Headline & Title Formulas](#headline--title-formulas) section below for comprehensive formulas and examples.

---

### Phase 5: Differentiation & Anti-Patterns

**The Originality Framework:**

**Step 1: Competitive Audit**
Before creating, search for competing lead magnets in your niche. Ask:
- What format is everyone using? (Do something different)
- What topics are overdone? (Find the gap)
- What language/positioning is stale? (Reframe it)

**Step 2: Pattern Interrupt**
If everyone has a "Free Guide," create an "Interactive Assessment."
If everyone has a "Checklist," create a "Calculator."
If everyone promises "More Leads," promise "Better Leads."

**Step 3: Contrarian Angle**
| Overdone Positioning | Contrarian Alternative |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Ultimate Guide to X" | "The Anti-Guide: What NOT to Do" |
| "5 Steps to Success" | "The 1 Thing That Actually Matters" |
| "Free Training" | "The $500 Training I'm Giving Away" |
| "Download Now" | "Take This 2-Min Assessment First" |

---

### What Doesn't Work (Avoid These)

- ❌ Generic titles: "Free Guide," "Learn More," "Resources"
- ❌ Vague promises: "Get Better Results" (better than what?)
- ❌ Too clever/confusing (clarity > cleverness)
- ❌ Too long (60+ characters = worse on mobile)
- ❌ No specific benefit stated
- ❌ No timeframe or urgency signal
- ❌ Weak action verbs (Get, Have, Make vs. Unlock, Breakthrough, Transform)

---

### Title Length & Platform Optimization

**Mobile Optimization (Most Important):**
- Headline: 40-50 characters max (will get cut off on mobile)
- Full title can be longer, but lead with the hook

**Desktop Headlines:**
- 60-80 characters = sweet spot
- Long headlines can work but need strong subheading

**Split Structure:**
```
Headline: "Double Your Income Without Hustle" (32 chars)
Subheading: "The Delegation System Used by 5,000+ Professionals"
```

```

### Format 4: Template/Swipe File

**Best Conversion Rate: 30-40%**

#### When to Use
- Audience needs to CREATE something
- Fill-in-the-blank is valuable
- "Give me the words" scenarios
- Reusable asset

#### Structure
```
1. Context: When to use this template
2. Template: Ready-to-use format
3. Instructions: How to customize
4. Examples: Filled-in versions
5. Variations: Different scenarios
```

#### Best Practices
- Actually fill in part of it (don't just show blanks)
- Include 2-3 complete examples
- Explain the WHY behind each section
- Make it copy-paste ready
- Provide in multiple formats (Google Doc, Word, Notion)

#### Example Structure
```
Template: "Cold Email Sequence That Books Meetings"

Email 1: The Pattern Interrupt
Subject: [Specific observation about their company]

Hi [Name],

I noticed [specific observation] about [Company].

Most [industry] companies I work with struggle with [problem].
We helped [similar company] achieve [specific result].

Would a 15-minute call to explore this make sense?

[Your name]

---

Customization:
- [Specific observation]: Look at their LinkedIn, website, or recent news
- [Problem]: Match to your core offering
- [Specific result]: Use real case study number

Example Filled In:
Subject: Your checkout flow at Acme Co

Hi Sarah,

I noticed your mobile checkout has 5 steps—most e-commerce sites see 
35% cart abandonment at step 4.

We helped Retailer X reduce this to 2 steps, increasing conversions by 23%.

Would a 15-minute call to explore this make sense?

[Name]
```

---

### Format 5: Mini-Course (Video Series)

**Best Conversion Rate: 25-35%**

#### When to Use
- Complex topic needs explanation
- Trust-building is critical
- Audience prefers video learning
- Personality/teaching style is differentiator

#### Structure
```
1. Module 1: Hook + Quick Win (5-7 min)
2. Modules 2-4: Core content (5-10 min each)
3. Module 5: Bridge to paid offer (5 min)
Total: 25-45 minutes max
```

#### Best Practices
- Each video = one specific concept
- First video must deliver immediate value
- Keep videos under 10 minutes (attention spans)
- Include PDF companion with each video
- Drip over 3-5 days (not all at once)

#### Example Structure
```
Mini-Course: "5-Day Delegation Bootcamp"

Day 1: "The Delegation Mindset Shift" (6 min)
       - Why 80% of entrepreneurs fail at delegation
       - The 4-hour rule (your first quick win)
       - Action: Identify one task to delegate this week

Day 2: "What to Delegate First" (8 min)
       - The $10/$100/$1000 task framework

---

### Format 6: PDF Guide/Report

**Best Conversion Rate: 15-25%**

#### When to Use
- Deep education needed
- Authority building is goal
- Audience prefers reading
- Reference material needed

#### Structure
```
1. Executive summary (1 page)
2. The problem (2-3 pages)
3. The solution framework (5-10 pages)
4. Implementation guide (3-5 pages)
5. Next steps + CTA (1 page)
Total: 12-20 pages max
```

#### Best Practices
- Design matters MORE than length
- Use visuals, charts, callout boxes
- Break text with frequent headers
- Include action items throughout
- Make it skimmable (bold key points)

#### Critical: Don't Make a 50-Page PDF
```
❌ 50 pages = nobody reads it = no trust built
✅ 12-15 pages of high-density value = completed + remembered
```

---

---

### Delivery Best Practices

3. Set expectation for next communication

**The Thank-You Page:**
```
✅ Include: Lead magnet access link/embed

❌ Don't: Just say "Check your email"
❌ Don't: Ask for more information
❌ Don't: Overwhelm with multiple CTAs
```

## Anti-Patterns & Failure Modes

### The 15 Lead Magnet Killers

#### 1. Generic Titles

**The Problem:**
- "Free Guide" tells nobody anything
- "Resources" is invisible in a crowded market
- "Newsletter" has near-zero perceived value

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Marketing Guide"
❌ "Free Resources"
❌ "Subscribe to Our Newsletter"
❌ "Download Now"
```

**The Fix:**
```
✅ "The 7-Figure Sales Email Sequence (Copy-Paste Template)"
✅ "Your Burnout Score: The 2-Minute Assessment"
✅ "The $50K/Month Lead Generation Blueprint"
```

---

#### 2. No Specific Benefit

**The Problem:**
- "Get Better Results" — better than what?
- "Improve Your Business" — how specifically?
- Vague promises create vague interest (none)

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Learn how to succeed"
❌ "Tips for growth"
❌ "Strategies for improvement"
```

**The Fix:**
```
✅ "Double your email open rates in 7 days"
✅ "Add $10K/month with this pricing framework"
✅ "Cut your workweek by 15 hours with this delegation system"
```

---

#### 3. Too Long to Consume

**The Problem:**
- 50-page PDFs = 2% completion rate
- 2-hour video courses = abandoned
- Value never delivered = no trust built

**The Data:**
```
Lead magnet length vs. completion:
- 5 pages: 80% completion
- 15 pages: 50% completion
- 30 pages: 20% completion
- 50+ pages: <5% completion
```

**The Fix:**
- Target <15 minutes consumption time
- 10-15 page PDFs max
- 5-7 video mini-course modules (5-10 min each)
- Checklists: 7-15 items
- Quizzes: 2-5 minutes

---

#### 4. No Quick Win

**The Problem:**
- Value promised in weeks, not minutes
- No immediate gratification
- Lead moves on before experiencing anything

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Results in 90 days" (too long)
❌ "Over time you'll see..." (too vague)
❌ "After you implement all 47 steps..." (too much work)
```

**The Fix:**
- First win in <15 minutes
- "Try this right now" action items
- Show them their score/result immediately
- One quick implementation step

---

#### 5. Looks Cheap

**The Problem:**
- Poor design = low perceived value
- Amateur visuals = amateur business
- Trust destroyed before content consumed

**Red Flags:**
```
❌ Plain Word documents
❌ No branding/logo
❌ Stock photos everywhere
❌ 12pt Times New Roman
❌ Walls of text, no formatting
```

**The Fix:**
- Professional PDF design (Canva templates work)
- Consistent branding
- White space and visual hierarchy
- Custom graphics/diagrams
- Mobile-optimized layout

---

#### 6. Friction in Delivery

**The Problem:**
- Every additional step loses 20-40% of people
- Password requirements kill completion
- "Check your email" = abandonment

**Friction Points:**
```
❌ "Create an account to access"
❌ "Download this ZIP file"
❌ "Check your email" (only)
❌ 10-field forms
❌ Requires specific software to open
```

**The Fix:**
- Email only (name optional)
- Instant access on thank-you page
- Web-based consumption (not downloads)
- Mobile-friendly delivery
- No accounts, no passwords

---

#### 7. Overpromise, Underdeliver

**The Problem:**
- Title promises transformation
- Content delivers generic tips
- Trust destroyed permanently
- Negative word-of-mouth

**Examples:**
```
Title: "The Exact System That Made Me $1M"
Reality: 5 pages of generic advice anyone could Google

Title: "Your Personalized Growth Plan"
Reality: Same PDF everyone gets with no personalization
```

**The Fix:**
- Promise 8/10, deliver 10/10
- Be specific about what they'll get
- Actually personalize if you say "personalized"
- Under-promise in title, over-deliver in content

---

#### 8. No Connection to Paid Offer

**The Problem:**
- Attracts wrong people
- Creates unqualified leads
- Sales conversations don't connect
- Wasted marketing budget

**Examples:**
```
❌ Selling coaching, lead magnet is random tips
❌ Selling software, lead magnet is unrelated ebook
❌ Audience attracted has different problem than offer solves
```

**The Fix:**
- Lead magnet solves Problem A
- Solving A reveals Problem B
- Paid offer solves Problem B
- Natural progression, not hard pivot

---

#### 9. Information Without Action

**The Problem:**
- "Learn about X" creates no momentum
- Education without application = forgotten
- No behavior change = no trust

**Examples:**
```
❌ "Everything you need to know about..."
❌ "The complete guide to understanding..."
❌ "History of [topic]"
```

**The Fix:**
- Every section ends with action step
- Templates they can USE
- Worksheets they can FILL IN
- Tools they can APPLY

---

#### 10. Trying to Teach Everything

**The Problem:**
- "Ultimate Guide" overwhelms
- Comprehensive = abandoned
- Too much value = paralysis

**The Paradox:**
```
More content ≠ More value
More content = Less completion = Less trust

Counter-intuitive: 
A 10-page PDF that gets read > 100-page PDF that doesn't
```

**The Fix:**
- ONE narrow problem, solved COMPLETELY
- "This is the ONLY thing you need to know"
- Depth over breadth
- Complete solution to specific problem

---

#### 11. Outdated Content

**The Problem:**
- 2019 strategies in 2025 = irrelevant
- Screenshot of old interfaces = amateur
- Tactics that no longer work = harm

**Red Flags:**
```
❌ "2021 Trends" (still being promoted)
❌ Screenshots of old platform designs
❌ Tactics that platforms have changed
❌ Pre-AI strategies without AI context
```

**The Fix:**
- Update annually (at minimum)
- Add "Last Updated: [Date]" to build trust
- Remove time-specific references that will age
- When in doubt, focus on principles over tactics

---

#### 12. Copycat Positioning

**The Problem:**
- Same format as every competitor
- Same title structure
- Same promise
- No differentiation

**Examples:**
```
If everyone has:
- "Free Guide to [Topic]"
- "Ultimate Checklist"
- "5 Tips for..."

You blend in. Invisible. Ignored.
```

**The Fix:**
- Audit competitors BEFORE creating
- Choose different format if everyone uses PDFs
- Contrarian angle on common topic
- Unique mechanism or methodology

---

#### 13. No CTA or Next Step

**The Problem:**
- Lead magnet ends with... nothing
- No direction on what to do next
- Lost opportunity for progression

**Examples:**
```
❌ Ends with "Good luck!"
❌ No mention of paid offer
❌ No clear next action
❌ Multiple competing CTAs
```

**The Fix:**
- ONE clear next step
- Natural bridge to paid offer
- "If you want to go deeper..."
- Specific action: "Book a call" or "Start free trial"

---

#### 14. Asking for Too Much

**The Problem:**
- 10-field forms kill conversion
- Phone number required = -50% opt-ins
- Company size, revenue, etc. = friction

**Data:**
```
Fields vs. Conversion:
- Email only: 100% baseline
- Name + Email: -10%
- + Phone: -50%
- + Company: -30%
- + Title: -20%
- Each additional field: -10-20%
```

**The Fix:**
- Email only (minimum viable)
- Name optional
- Collect additional info AFTER they opt-in
- Ask qualifying questions in follow-up, not gate

---

#### 15. Wrong Awareness Level

**The Problem:**
- Teaching solutions to unaware audiences
- Selling to people not ready
- Content mismatch to buyer stage

**Examples:**
```
❌ "How to use our software" (to someone who doesn't know they have a problem)
❌ "Introduction to [basic topic]" (to experts)
❌ Comparison guide to level 1 awareness people
```

**The Fix:**
- Identify target awareness level
- Match content to that level
- Level 1-2: Problem revelation
- Level 3: Solution education
- Level 4-5: Proof and comparison

---

### The Competitive Differentiation Framework

#### Step 1: Audit Competitors

Before creating, search your niche and document:
- What formats are competitors using?
- What titles/angles are common?
- What's the quality level?
- What gaps exist?

#### Step 2: Identify the Zig

| If Everyone Does... | You Should... |
|---------------------|---------------|
| PDF guides | Interactive quiz |
| Generic tips | Specific methodology |
| Broad topic | Ultra-narrow slice |
| Education-focused | Action-focused |
| "Ultimate Guide" | "The ONLY thing you need" |
| Free content | "$500 value, free" |

#### Step 3: Contrarian Angles

| Overdone Positioning | Contrarian Alternative |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "More leads" | "Better leads" |
| "5 steps to success" | "The 1 thing that matters" |
| "How to do X" | "Why everything you know about X is wrong" |
| "Beginner's guide" | "The advanced-only framework" |
| "Free training" | "The training I charge $1000 for" |

5. **Choose Angle** → Be contrarian, specific, different from competitors
6. **Write Title** → Use formulas, include 2+ of the 4 U's, be specific
7. **Build Content** → Solve ONE problem completely, include templates, show your method
